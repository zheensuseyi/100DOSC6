Description:  To check your knowledge, hereâ€™s a small task for you: 
 create a struct to store information about a car, including its model, number of seats, and current gear, then add a method to change gears up or down.
 Have a think about variables and access control: what data should be a variable rather than a constant, and what data should be exposed publicly? Should the gear-changing method validate its input
 somehow?
